This set me up with a \"blank\" project.\n\nI then hooked up the CMS and figured out how to use it. The Gatby plugin for this made it relatively painless.\n\nThen, I built the landing page, the search pages, and blocked everything else out using super basic components.\n\nI then made sure all the site parts were where they should be, and then made them all look good using CSS. \n\nFinally, I put finalized the CMS content structure, and then built the rest of the pages around that.\n\nThis site is probably going to be a work in progress forever as I have ideas for new features or improvements. This is basically all the steps I've taken up until everything is good enough for me to consider it all mostly done.\n\n## What I learned\nThis project function less as a way to learn new technologies and more as a refresher. Before making this site I had not done a web-based project in a while, so it gave me a good reason to brush up on my CSS, JS, React/Gatsby knowledge, and data-based skills (pun intended there). \n\nI did learn a good amount about GatsbyJS while making the site, which was cool.","datePublished":"2021-08-03"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsProject-50725352-en","slug":"this-site","__params":{"slug":"this-site"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
