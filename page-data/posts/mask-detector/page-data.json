Finesse and opportunism.\n\nThis project is a super low-effort mask detector written using C++/OpenCV. It basically checks if it can see a mouth within any faces that it sees, and if it doesn't it concludes there is mask present.\n\nYou can download this project [here](https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/Mask-Detector).\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nThis project was written in C++, built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), and used the [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/). \n\n## What I Learned\n\nThis was my first multi-file C++ project, so I learned a decent amount about how to break C++ projects out into encapsulated pieces of functionality and also about how to link all those together using CMake.\n\nIn order to get it all to compile correctly I also couldn't rely on super simple `CMakeLists.txt` files, so I also had to learn a bit about how to write those for this project.\n\nI was already reasonably familiar with both C++ programming and OpenCV, so I didn't really learn much more about those. \n\nAll in all, I'd say I learned a decent amount this project, and it was definitely fun messing around with OpenCV more. \n","datePublished":"2021-08-04"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsProject-50818343-en","slug":"mask-detector","__params":{"slug":"mask-detector"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
