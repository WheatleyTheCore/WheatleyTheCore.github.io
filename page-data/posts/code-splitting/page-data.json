The bigger our app is the longer our loading times, which leads to a worse user experience and a less accessible app.\n\nCode splitting helps solve this problem. Code splitting \"splits\" your bundle, loading parts of your app only when they are needed. This means that your app initially loads faster, and the parts that the user don't use aren't even loaded. This \"load as needed\" process is called lazy loading.\n\n## How Do I Do It?\n\nYour bundler (e.g. Webpack, Rollup) handles bundling. It makes sense then that your bundler handles code splitting. \n\nIn React, one way of implementing code splitting is with dynamic imports. For example:\n\n`\nimport(x).then(x => x.doY);\n`\n\nWebpack sees this and will automatically implement code splitting for you. For other bundlers it might look a little different, so if you're using something else it would probably be a good idea to check the docs for your specific bundler.\n\nThere is also a React.lazy package that can implement it, however it isn't fully implemented. A good alternative (according to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html)) is the [loadable components library](https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components).\n\nImplementing code splitting well means only loading what is needed for whatever section of the page they are on, but not needing to load things super frequently (which might lead to the user noticing not everything is loaded, which is bad for user experience). \n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo that is what code splitting is and how it works. It's not super hard to implement, but it has a huge impact. For more info, the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) has a good page on this.\n\n","datePublished":"2021-08-07"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsArticle-51276118-en","slug":"code-splitting","__params":{"slug":"code-splitting"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
