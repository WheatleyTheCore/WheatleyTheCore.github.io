I started out with these circuit sculptures by following [Jiří Praus's LED Jewlery Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/LED-Jewelry/). \n\nAfter a semi-functional result (more on that later), I decided to try something a little bigger, specifically a little desk thermometer shaped like a vintage TV (the ones that were low to the ground and massive). While my sculpting skills have room to improve I think it came out pretty good, and it functions as it should.\n\nThe code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/MCS08QD4-Temperature-Sensor).\n\n## The Parts\n\nThe brains of this project is the [MC9S08QD4 microprocessor](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MC9S08QD4.pdf). I programmed it using the CodeWarrior IDE and Processor expert.\n\nI harvested an TM1637-based display (which most 7 segment display modules use), and wrote [this library](https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/TM1637-Lib) to interface with it.\n\nI also used a cheap temperature sensing module I had lying around to sense tenmperature.\n\nOther than that I just used some brass wire I had lying around.\n\n## What I learned\n\nTwo interesting things I found out while making this project:\n\t1. Resistance based temperature sensors don't give linear values, but rather a logorithmic output.\n\t2. Brass wire is often coated in a laquer or some kind. If you're doing something like this, **SAND YOUR WIRE FIRST**. Otherwise soldering to it *sucks*.\n\t\nThis was also my first time writing a library for embedded devices (I think). So that was also a skill I picked up while making this.
