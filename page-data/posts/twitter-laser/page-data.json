I made it in seventh grade, and as such I probably wont remember every single detail about the process by which it was made. I think it is a pretty cool project though (and was my first real venture into hardware projects) so I still wanted to write a post on it.\n\nSo this is a twitter controlled laser pointer. Essentially, it would listen to a twitter account I made for it, and in the event it got a tweet in the form `X[some number] Y[Some Number]` it would use the tweet to position the laser pointer. \n\nIt was essentially a twitterbot that talked to an arduino. \n\nYou can find the code [here](https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/twitter-controlled-laser).\n\n## How I made it\n\nSo I first watched a few tutorials (which can be found in the `README.md` file on the Github repo). \n\nThen, using both the [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) and [Serialport](https://serialport.io/docs/guide-installation/) library for Javascript, I built the twitterbot, which would just send any coordinates recieved to the arduino.\n\nAfter that I wrote the arduino code, which parsed the coordinates it recieved and positioned the laser pointer (which was controlled by some servos) accordingly.\n\n## What I learned\n\nThis project was the one that sparked my love for programming and making things with hardware. It was the first time I built something other than just a blinky light or something similar, and it showed me that I could actually make cool stuff using technology.\n\nOn the more technical side, during this project I learned how serial communications worked, how twitterbots worked in general (and how to implement them), and how to parse data in C++, all of which are fairly useful skills.","datePublished":"2021-08-05"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsProject-50990319-en","slug":"twitter-laser","__params":{"slug":"twitter-laser"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
