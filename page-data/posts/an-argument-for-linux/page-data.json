It was first created by Linus Torvalds, and is one of the most popular operating systems in the world.\n\nWhile it may not be as well known as MacOS or Windows, Linux is used far more. Not necessarily for personal computing, but for embedded devices, like automotive and aeronautic operating systems, mobile phones (for example Android is built on linux), and IOT devices.\n\nIt is often used by some (myself included) as their everyday operating system on their computers.\n\n## How Is It Different From Other Operating Systems?\n\nFirst off, linux is completely open-source. This means that if you want to read through or contribute to the code running on your laptop, you totally can. This makes it waaaayyyy easier to diagnose and remedy errors or other problems you are having. \n\nMost programmers using MacOS know the pain of getting an esoteric error message only to find that an update made it so some software no longer works or that it's some bug that you have to jump through a myriad of hoops to circumvent. On linux this isn't as big a deal, you can edit most (if not all) of the files on your system, meaning you can just fix the bug itself if you really need to.\n\nSpeaking of errors, the Linux community is mostly programmers (since most Linux distributions require some level of technical know-how in order to use them), meaning that a pretty large proportion of the Linux community run across errors. This means that if you google an error message you're pretty much certain to find someone who has also had it, and will probably also find a fix on that same page. \n\nAs previously mentioned, you can edit pretty much all the files on your system, from the bootloader config to your program files. Linux gives you complete control over your system (assuming you have root privilages). This also makes your life easier, since you are never told that you aren't allowed to do something; in fact, there is pretty much always documentation for whatever you are doing.\n\nLinux is also relatively secure, at least way more secure than Windows. And if you need extra security you can always add more.\n\nAnother nicety that Linux offers is modularity. Linux uses packages (self-enclosed bits of functionality, apps, etc.) that can be installed or uninstalled at will. You don't like your window manager? Swap it out for another. \n\n## Why Use It Over Others?\n\nLinux does require you to learn how your system works (at least to some extent). This may pose a barrier for some, but if that's not a deal-breaker for you then your system will be entirely under your control. \n\nWhether you want to customize your background, the program that manages you background, your status bar, or the kernel modules you are using, Linux has you covered. \n\nIt's got an insanely knowledable (if not a little bit snobby in some cases) community, and you can solve pretty much any problem that arises.\n\nPlus, package managers make life SO much easier. \n\n## In Closing\nLinux may not be for everyone. However, if you like messing with your system and are sick of dealing with the errors that arise with using MacOS or the security vulnerabilities that come with Windows, I'd wholeheartedly suggest giving it a try.\n\n\n","datePublished":"2021-08-04"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsArticle-50824348-en","slug":"an-argument-for-linux","__params":{"slug":"an-argument-for-linux"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
