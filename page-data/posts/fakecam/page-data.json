For example, one could hypothetically use it to make it appear one is in any virtual class, when in reality they are off doing other stuff. I'd just like to say I don't condone doing such things. You would be cheating yourself out of your education, and also deceiving your teachers who just want to help you pass your class.\n\n## The Project\nNow that that's out of the way, let me tell you about the time I built an app that made it so you could record video of yourself and then run it through a virtual webcam.\n\nThe code can be found [here](https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/FakeCam/tree/main).\n\nBasically, it connects to a virtual loopback device created using [v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback), and then allows the user to switch back and forth between sending a looping video to that device or the actual webcam feed.\n\nThis loopback device can be selected just as a normal webcam input in things like google classroom or zoom.\n\nUnfortunately this will only be run on Linux due to the Linux-specific kernel module that it uses.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nThe first iteration of this project was written using [OpenCV](https://) to handle video processing, [PyFakeWebcam](https://github.com/jremmons/pyfakewebcam) to interface with the v4l2loopback device, and [PyGame](https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handle the GUI. \n\nThe second iteration aimed to use GTK, implemented using [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make a more fully-featured GUI and add the ability to record video to loopback while also sending the camera input to the lookback device. It got most of the way there, but was never actually finished.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nThis project was my first time messing with loopback devices, kernel modules, and my first time using multithreading/subprocesses in python.\n\nI also learned a lot about making GUIs in python, getting some experience with both PyGObject and PyGame. \n\n","datePublished":"2021-08-04"}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsProject-50818005-en","slug":"fakecam","__params":{"slug":"fakecam"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
